# PhoneGap Start on Boot Plugin

for Android

## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to show a application on boot Android.
It's great for showing a non intrusive native notification which is guaranteed always in the viewport of the browser.
* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).
* Officially supported by [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins).

## 3. Installation

### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)
Toast is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI (backup your project first!):

```
$ phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/asxtecnologia/phonegap-startup.git
```
or
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/asxtecnologia/phonegap-startup.git
$ cordova prepare
```

There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

## 5. CREDITS

The Android code was entirely created by me.
